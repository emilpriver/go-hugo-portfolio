I think something important in life is to find the thing we love to do, a passion. I'm speaking about that one thing we can't live without - such as reading books, painting, building stuff, cars, whatever. For me, this is software engineering.

I love software engineering and I have tremendous passion for it - I literally see myself being a software engineer until I die. I love everything about it: meetups, reading tech articles, debates, having problems that frustrate you until you solve them. I love learning new frameworks, languages, techniques, and ways to build systems. I enjoy going to meetups where you meet individuals who also love programming and debate topics even when I think they're completely crazy and wrong. I love flashing my computer to Ubuntu, then trying Arch, Nix and PopOS, only to go back to Arch again. My fianc√©e bought me a shirt that says "In data we trust" - one of several tech-themed shirts I own. My Sunday mornings with coffee and my dog on my lap are pure gold. As you can probably tell, system development is my greatest passion, and even though I've been told that my job isn't who I am, I still want to claim there are exceptions.

Six years ago, I embarked on a journey that took considerable time and that I'm still not finished with. The primary goal was not to lose weight - it was to become healthier and have more energy, and losing weight was the solution to my goal. At my peak, I weighed 143.7 kg and was 194 cm tall, with much of it being fat. I was constantly tired and never had energy to try anything new. I ate enormous amounts of food, candy, and soda - easily 3-4 kilos of candy per week. If I had gone to a doctor, they probably would have said I was on the verge of diabetes. It was bad, really bad.

But what frustrated me wasn't that I was overweight and ate so much junk food. It was that I was constantly exhausted. I slept poorly, was constantly tired during the day, which in turn made me mentally fatigued when doing what I love - building systems. There wasn't much energy left for innovation, and I couldn't maintain focus - it was literally shit. Another effect of being overweight was that I slept poorly, which in turn made me often stressed and wound up.

When COVID-19 began, I started working from home like many others, but unlike other countries, we in Sweden were allowed to go outside during restrictions - for example, I could go out for walks. So when COVID started, I began taking lunch walks, which became the start of losing 40 kilos and beginning a much healthier life that includes exercise and better sleep.

Often when I talk about system development with people who don't program themselves, I get the question "isn't it a lot of math?" and the answer to that question is yes and no. The math that exists for most developers isn't the usual addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but problem-solving from math. There are absolutely those who have much more math than most people do, but usually it's pretty basic math. When I solved problem-solving tasks in school over long periods, I was usually tired, which was easy to see - the first problems were solved well, but the longer the time went on, the more sloppy I became. Programming is somewhat similar - we have a lot of problem-solving. When I had a poor lifestyle, I lost focus quickly and became tired quickly. My solutions were poor and had little creativity.

Already during my transformation, but especially after, I noticed clear differences where I had significantly more energy when programming. My solutions became much better, more thoughtful, less stressed, and more elegant. My energy for learning more, exploring, and testing new software has increased tremendously. There's much more love in the solutions that get built.

Now, six years later, I still have some fat on my stomach. When I lost 40 kilos, I started going to the gym more and did a dirty bulk where I gained weight with both fat and muscle, which doesn't bother me at all because I've achieved one of my goals - a much healthier life that has given me much more energy for my passion. My favorite food is still sausage stroganoff and hamburgers. I'm more than happy to drink a Stigberget beer on Fridays with some chips. But the biggest difference now compared to then is that today I have much more physical activity - I walk more with my dog, play basketball, and go to the gym. There are days when I'm not so keen on working out or walking, especially when it's raining outside, but the most important thing is to be consistent. Motivation comes and goes, but being consistent doesn't come and go unless we choose to break it.
Sometimes the best thing we can do to solve a problem is to take a 20-minute walk or go to the gym.

Software engineering and physical activity is closely tied together and both super important and it's important that we take care of both parts
