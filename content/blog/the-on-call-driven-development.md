I've been thinking about this topic for a while now. On-call duty is something we rely on, but also dislike. Many businesses believe it's necessary for reliability in case something goes wrong. My issue isn't with having someone available to respond to alerts, which is always beneficial. My concern is with how on-call duty affects us engineers.

At one of the companies I worked for, I was on-call every six weeks, and sometimes for a few days in between those six-week periods. The extra pay was nice, and we didn't have much to do while on-call, thanks to our automated systems and well-designed processes. The requirements for on-call developers at that company was clear:
If something went down, our job was to get it up and running again, either by restarting a service or applying one of the scripts from the "run-this-scripts-if-prod-is-down" repository. However, we weren't expected to start debugging to find the root cause of the issue; that was left to the team owning the service on the next working day. I thought this approach was reasonable.

My problem with on-call duty isn't the concept itself, but rather how we engineers use it â€“ often due to our own laziness or because we're put in situations that encourage laziness. This is my main pain point: the mindset that develops when we know we have an on-call team with a "fire extinguisher" ready to go when production goes down. The issue I have is that we rely on the on-call team as a safety net to ensure the services we're responsible for are up and running.

I think this happens for a couple of reasons, but I believe the two biggest factors are bad management and laziness.

We developers are known for sometimes taking shortcuts, especially when we are put in that position by management, such as when we work with sprints, SAFe, and all of the evilness that corporates create to manage their engineers. When we have someone on call to support us, it is quite easy to deploy a new release on a Friday afternoon and then call it a day. However, this is not how we should operate. If we removed this safety net, we would probably not release on a Friday and instead wait until the next week to release it properly.

## The end
My biggest problem is really not that on-call exists or that we use it, and I totally understand why we use it. My issues is how we use it
