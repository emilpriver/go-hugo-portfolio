description: "About ai"
---
For the last 1.5 years have I forced myself to work and learn AI mostly because the future of the software engineering will have more AI within. I've really been focusing on optimizing my workflow into learning when AI is a good use-case and when it's a bad use-case. And now, 1.5 years later do I feel confident enough to say that I think I've learned AI good enough to have some opinions about it and this is why this post is written.

AI is a super hyped thing who somehow most engineers dislike and non-engineers like. Github claims that [20 million users use copilot](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/github-copilot-crosses-20-million-all-time-users/)

I've been using IDEs, chat interfaces, web interfaces such as Lovable

## Vibe coding
## Good stuff
## Tech debt
## We don't become more efficient
## The gainer of AI is not the developers, is the people around
