I've been an AI pesimistic since the rise of LLMs, mainly because they worked quite bad and everything it generated was quite bad, but also because no one understood it. It many people still dont understand AI. AI is still this overhyped thing which slowley is becoming less hyped. But, even if LLMs today is still quite bad in terms of comparing with a human on coding skillz is there still some thing we can use it to optimize my day.

The last year have I been working on optimising my setup + the way I write code when I use AI just because I do see some benefits with it
