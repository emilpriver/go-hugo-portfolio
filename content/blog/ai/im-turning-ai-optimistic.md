I've been an AI pessimist since the rise of LLMs, mainly because they worked quite poorly and everything they generated was quite bad, but also because no one understood it. Many people still don't understand AI. AI is still this overhyped thing that is slowly becoming less hyped. But, even if LLMs today are still quite bad in terms of comparing with a human on coding skills, there are still some things we can use it for to optimize our day.

But even if AI is still quite bad and what it generates is quite poor, I have become faster when I build systems because I am offloading all the simple stuff to AI so I can do the more complicated things. For instance, a while ago I added bulk endpoints to an existing API and I asked AI for help. The job that AI did for me was copying the existing functionality from the non-bulk endpoints, adding goroutines, handling each item in the bulk request independently, and adding channels for success and failure messages. By asking AI for help, I probably saved a day of work, which I think is fantastic. But I do understand the people who say they don't get any improvement from AI, especially developers who work at a lower level than I do.

My whole goal has always been to replace all the boring tasks with AI so I can focus on the fun stuff (the more complicated things).

For the last year, I have been working on optimizing my setup and the way I write code when I use AI, just because I do see some benefits with it. In this last year's journey, I have tried:
1. AI-powered IDEs such as Cursor, but I realized that it's dangerous to have something recommending code before you have thought about what you want to do.
2. Just using web-powered stuff such as Gemini or Claude's website and then copying code.
3. CLIs that work with an AI such as Aider or Opencode.
