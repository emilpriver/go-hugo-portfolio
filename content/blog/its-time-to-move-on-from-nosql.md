There are a few things and directions we developers have taken that I think were probably not good things, such as NoSQL. Back in 2019 and probably even earlier, many developers looked into Lambda functions because they solved the problems of unexpected traffic spikes for our system, and don't get me wrong, they probably did. But they didn't solve the problem of our wallets not printing money on demand, but that is a different story.

When we started to use Lambda functions even more, we realized that if we use Lambda functions which we don't have a lot of control over, we also need to have a database which can scale up automatically when our traffic scales up too, and at the time, that seemed to be NoSQL databases.
