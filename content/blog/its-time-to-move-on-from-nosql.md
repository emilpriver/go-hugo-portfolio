I started my programming career in the serverless area, right when Kuberenetes started to get popular. And during this time many devs wanted to move of taking care of their own infrastructure and VMs and run everything in the serverless which was great, we could now focus on the features rather then infrastructure.
Everything was serverless, serverless HTTP handlers, serverless scale to infinity and to 0 and even serverless automation of ordering pizza from pizza hut.
