I really don't like Test Driven Development, Domain Driven Development, The Clean Code philosophy or most of the things we have which tell us how we should write code, mostly because they never work in codebases that should last for years, And I am not really a fan of Apple even if the title includes the name of the creator of Apple. In the matter of fact, I am the only one in my big fammily who moved away from Apple entierly and now uses Linux and Android. Mostly because it brings more peace to my everyday work but also that I really don't get why you want to use an Iphone when the best new thing Apple could come up with was adding opacity 0.8 to all UI.
