I started to write Rust in the autumn of 2022 and have since then loved it, even if the learning curve is kinda huge but when you start to understand how the language works is it pretty easy to work with it.

Short about Rust
Rust is a highly flexible, type safe, blazingly fast high performance language without runtime or garbage collector that can be used on a wide area of domains, such as in the Web, embedded or to be used for networking stuff. The Rust compiler called rustc, compiles the code into LLVM to create platform independent almost machine code.
