It's kind of amazing to think about how far we have come with technology. Our phones now have the capability of sending a rocket to Mars and can detect heart issues before we even realize it. We can even call our grandma who lives on another continent with great quality.

The way we build our applications has also changed significantly. Today's developers are more interested in where we want to be rather than how we get there. We focus on millions of users before we even start the project and design our applications accordingly. Many people may not even realize they are doing this, as much of the content on building systems is focused on scaling up.

The interesting part of this quote is how true it is, yet most developers do not even realize it. Many times, when developers design and create new systems, they focus on the millions of events they anticipate in the future before considering what is necessary for the application from the start. The most challenging aspect of getting to a millions of events/users is the path to achieve them.
