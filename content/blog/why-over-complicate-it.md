It's kind of amazing to think about how far we have come with technology. Our phones now have the capability of sending a rocket to Mars and can detect heart issues before we even realize it. We can even call our grandma who lives on another continent with great quality.

The way we build our applications has also changed significantly. I read an article by Tailscale titled ["The New Internet"](https://tailscale.com/blog/new-internet) where they discuss this change.
> Programmers today are impatient for success. They start planning for a billion users before they write their first line of code. In fact, nowadays, we train them to do this without even knowing they’re doing it. Everything they’ve ever been taught revolves around scaling.

And the interesting part of this quote is how true it is without most developers even realize it. So many times when developers design and create new systems do we think of the millions of events we think we will have in the future before we think of what we want or need for the application.
