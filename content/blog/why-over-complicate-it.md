It's kind of amazing to think about how far we have come with technology. Our phones now have the capability of sending a rocket to Mars and can detect heart issues before we even realize it. We can even call our grandma who lives on another continent with great quality.

The way we build our applications has also changed significantly. Today's developers are more interested in where we want to be rather than how we get there. We focus on millions of users before we even start the project and design our applications accordingly. Many people may not even realize they are doing this, as much of the content on building systems is focused on scaling up. The hardest part about building a system and a company is not getting a million of users, it's finding the first 10000 or less active users. 

Many developers seem to have forgotten that today's hardware has evolved significantly since 2018. The best way to handle a large number of users is by using horizontally scaled systems, Kubernetes, and serverless technology. In reality, many of these systems could run smoothly on a Google Pixel or a Raspberry PI.

## We're to afraid of that our systems will go down

## To complex systems
