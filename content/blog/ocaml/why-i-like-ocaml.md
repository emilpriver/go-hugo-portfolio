According to my Linkedin profile, I have been writing code for a company for almost 6 years. During this time, I have worked on PHP and Wordpress projects, built e-commerce websites using NextJS and JavaScript, written small backends in Python with Django/Flask/Fastapi, and developed fintech systems in GO, among other things. I have come to realize that I value a good type system and prefer writing code in a more functional way rather than using object-oriented programming. For example, in GO, I prefer passing in arguments rather than creating a `struct` method. This is why I will be discussing OCaml in this article.

For those who may not be familiar with OCaml and the type of programming language it is, I will provide a brief overview. If you are interested in more information, I have written a post called "OCaml introduction."

OCaml is a multi-paradigm language that originated in the 1990s and leans more towards the functional approach. While it is possible to write object-oriented code in OCaml, most developers prefer to write in a functional style and only use OOP when it is a better fit, as building an application entirely functionally can complicate some use cases. OCaml is derived from the Meta Language (ML) and shares features such as the type system and type inference. Unlike many functional languages, OCaml does allow side effects and is not as strict as, for instance, Haskell.
