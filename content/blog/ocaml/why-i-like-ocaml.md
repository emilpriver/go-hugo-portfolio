- Hindleyâ€“Milner type system
- type inference
- pattern matching


-----
According to my Linkedin profile, I have been writing code for a company for almost 6 years. During this time, I have worked on PHP and Wordpress projects, built e-commerce websites using NextJS and JavaScript, written small backends in Python with Django/Flask/Fastapi, and developed fintech systems in GO, among other things. I have come to realize that I value a good type system and prefer writing code in a more functional way rather than using object-oriented programming. For example, in GO, I prefer passing in arguments rather than creating a `struct` method. This is why I will be discussing OCaml in this article.

If you are not familiar with the language OCaml or need a brief overview of it, I recommend reading my post [OCaml introduction](https://priver.dev/blog/ocaml/ocaml-introduction/) before continuing with this post. It will help you better understand the topic I am discussing.

## Hindley-Milner type system and type inference
Almost every time I ask someone what they like about OCaml, they often say "oh, the type system is really nice" or "I really like the Hindley-Milner type system." When I ask new OCaml developers what they like about the language, they often say "This type system is really nice, Typescript's type system is actually quite garbage." I am not surprised that these people say this, as I agree 100%. I really enjoy the Hindley-Milner type system and I think this is also the biggest reason why I write in this language. A good type system can make a huge difference for your developer experience.

For those who may not be familiar with the Hindley-Milner type system, it can be described as a system where you write a piece of program with strict types, but you are not required to explicitly state the types. Instead, the type is inferred based on how the variable is used. 
Let's look at some code to demonstrate what I mean. In GO, you would be required to define the type of the arguments:

```go
package main

func Hello(name string) {
  fmt.Println(name)
}
```

However, in OCaml, you don't need to specify the type:

```OCaml
let hello name = 
  print_endline name
```
Since `print_endline` expects to receive a string, the signature for `hello` will be:
```OCaml
val hello : string -> unit
```

But it's not just for arguments, it's also used when returning a value.

```OCaml
let hello name = 
  match name with 
  | Some value -> "We had a value" 
  | None -> 1
```

This function will not compile because we are trying to return a string as the first value and later an integer. 
I also want to provide a larger example of the Hindley-Milner type system:

```OCaml
module Hello = struct
  type car = {
    car: string;
    age: int;
  }

  let make car_name age = { car = car_name; age }

  let print_car_name car = print_endline car.car

  let print_car_age car = print_int car.age
end

let () =
  let car = Hello.make "Volvo" 12 in
  Hello.print_car_name car;
  Hello.print_car_age car
```

The signature for this piece of code will be:

```OCaml
module Hello :
  sig
    type car = { car : string; age : int; }
    val make : string -> int -> car
    val print_car_name : car -> unit
    val print_car_age : car -> unit
  end
```

In this example, we create a new module where we expose 3 functions: make, print_car_age, and print_car_name. We also define a type called `car`. One thing to note in the code is that the type is only defined once, as OCaml infers the type within the functions since `car` is a type within this scope.

Something important to note before concluding this section is that you can define both the argument types and return types for your function.

```OCaml
let hello (name: string) : int = 
  print_endline name;
  1
```
## Pattern matching & Variants
The next topic is pattern matching. I really enjoy pattern matching in programming languages. I have written a lot of Rust, and pattern matching is something I use when I write Rust. Rich pattern matching is beneficial as it eliminates the need for many if statements. Additionally, in OCaml, you are required to handle every case of the match statement.

For example, in the code below:

```OCaml
let hello name = 
  match name with 
  | "Emil" -> print_endline "Hello Emil"
  | "Sabine the OCaml queen" -> print_endline "Raise your swords soldiers, the queen has arrived"
  | value -> Printf.printf "Hello stranger %s" value
```

In the code above, I am obligated to include the last match case as we would not have handled every case unless, for instance, what should the compiler do if the `name` is Adam.
Now the example above is a really simple one, We can also match on a int and do different stuff depending on the number value.

```OCaml
let allowed_to_join age =
  match age with
  | 0 -> print_endline "Can you even walk lol"
  | value when value > 18 ->
    print_endline "Welcome in my friend, the beer is on Sabine"
  | _ -> print_endline "Your not allowed, go home and play minecraft"

let () = allowed_to_join 2
```
