The last year i've forced myself to start to use AI a bit more and give it some more of my energy because I do think it can be a good tool within my development and help me with some efficiency on simpler tasks. Also latley have the AI improved a bit to be able to solve the simpler tasks as 1 year ago was they still quite bad and messed up a lot but now when AI most of the time comes a "thinking" mode is it able to solve a bit more. Ai is also something almost every app have nowadays, we have it in mails, keep, sms and so on. 

AI is great for boilerplate code, proof of concepts, simple tasks as add a field to a struct and populate that field in the app, however, it's horrible when we need to make a bit harder tasks which requires some understanding and thinking such as building the buisness logic. The most hardest problems there exists in programming is not related to code, it's related to how the thing we're building should work, e.g the details.

  I've never been a fan of adding ai auto-complete such as Cursors tab in my PDE(Personalised development Enviroment) nvim, it mostly is annyoing because it's recommending code which I dont want or even solve the problem i am working on and this have been the same experience when I've used Cursor and Zed which both have AI agents and tab like experience. However, I knew that I wanted something which is not a browser so I found [Aider](https://aider.chat/) which is an terminal application which provides a nice simple interface which allows me to add files to the context and so on which been nice.
