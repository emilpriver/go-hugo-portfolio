This is an easy recipe for shrimp risotto that serves 4 people and takes about an hour to make.

## Ingredients

- 4 dl risotto rice
- About 800g of shrimp (depends on how much shrimp you want per serving)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 carrot
- 1 yellow onion
- 1 shallot
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 dl cooking wine
- 1 vegetable broth cube
- 1.5 dl grated parmesan
- Butter
- Salt
- Pepper
- About 2 tbsp of parsley (to taste)

## Preparation

1. Peel the shrimp and put the shells in a large saucepan (should hold about 5-6 dl of water). Place the peeled shrimp in a bowl and refrigerate.
2. Finely chop 1 carrot and 1 yellow onion. Finely chop the shallot and garlic separately.
3. Add the chopped carrot and onion to the saucepan with the shrimp shells and sauté for about 3-5 minutes.
4. Pour in 5-7 dl of water and add 2 vegetable broth cubes. Let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.
5. After 10-15 minutes, strain the shrimp stock, so you're left with only the liquid.

## Risotto

1. In a separate saucepan, add a little butter and olive oil, then sauté the shallot and garlic for a minute without browning them.
2. Pour in the cooking wine and risotto rice, and let it come to a boil.
3. Add about 3 dl of the shrimp stock and 2-3 dl of water to the saucepan. Let it simmer over medium heat for about 20 minutes. Add more stock/water as the liquid gets absorbed by the rice. The rice should have a slight chewiness and the liquid should mostly be absorbed for the risotto to be ready.
4. Season with salt and pepper, and add more wine or broth if needed.
5. Stir in the grated parmesan and a knob of butter before serving, allowing them to melt into the risotto. This will make the risotto creamier.
6. Serve the risotto with some shrimp and parsley on top.

Enjoy your delicious shrimp risotto!
