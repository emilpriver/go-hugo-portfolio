I recently read [Steve Yegge's](https://x.com/Steve_Yegge) new article ["Revenge of the junior developer"](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer) and the article is essentially about how some junior devs like AI embrace a world where programmers allow AI to do most of the work and it was a good article because I started to think about this topic and wanted to write something about it.

This topic is a topic which have created discussions and i've been contributing in the past with my article [My Love/Hate Letter to Copilot](https://priver.dev/blog/ai/my-love-hate-letter-to-copilot/) and the TLDR of that article is that I think that when we integration AI so heavily into our code-flow does it make us lazy because we just apply all the suggestions and really don't think about what the code actually does which later on creates bugs and hard to read code and I do still stand by this. AI helps us create worse software.

But there is 1 other part of this which I've thought of which is that AI helps entry or junior devs be able to produce solutions even if they don't have the skills to do it. Probably not the best code, but it's something, which I think is really really good mainly as the most important thing when your a new developer is to write software, use it(publish it, deploy it, whatever), get feedback and learn from the feedback which can be that production breaks, slow queries, test suite fails or a colleague which says the code is not good. Because the whole point of being a junior developer is to learn and explore software engineering, that's the reason why a junior is paid less then a senior.
