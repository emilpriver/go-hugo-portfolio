## About
I am a self-taught software engineer from Göteborg, Sweden, with a profound interest in engineering and software development. I have gained experience in several areas since I started programming. These involve creating product searches for e-commerce websites, building data pipelines, and designing scalable payout systems capable of handling thousands of payouts simultaneously. In my spare time, I primarily read about technology, work on hobby projects, and explore new concepts within programming.

## Education
- **High School, Summer 2018**
  - **System Developer, Varberg**
  - Studied to be a system engineer but found the school's teaching methods not aligned with my learning style. I often took the assignment and built it "my way," meaning I did research and then built the solution.

## Experience
- **Software Engineer, March 2024 - Ongoing**
  - **CarbonCloud, Göteborg**
  - Building a platform to help companies become more climate-neutral. Working with a lot of data and automating calculations from the data team.
  - Providing an API for merchants to send data to.
  - This is a ongoing employment and I add more during my employment 
- **Software Engineer, August 2022 - March 2024**
  - **Zimpler, Göteborg**
  - Built integrations between Zimpler and banks. Helped Zimpler become more data-driven by building a data pipeline that reads data from the entire system and filters out unnecessary data, storing the rest in a data warehouse. Developed a new scalable payout system for Zimpler, capable of handling 4-5000 transactions per second without system slowdowns.

- **Software Engineer, Spring 2019 - August 2022**
  - **Rivercode, Borås**
  - Worked on the backend parts of e-commerce websites, connecting front-end to CMS or building product searches on top of Elasticsearch. Launched websites like morrisstockholm.com, axelarigato.com, and vikingfootwear.com. Built a product recommendation system for bangerhead based on customer skin type.

- **Web Developer, Autumn 2017 - Spring 2018**
  - **Team Property, Stockholm**
  - Built and maintained Team Property's website and managed their social media channels.
