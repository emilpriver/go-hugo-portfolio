Hi, I'm Emil Privér, a software engineer from Göteborg, Sweden. I am currently building TBA

In my free time, I primarily develop services using Rust, Go, and OCaml. I also enjoy writing articles and exploring the realm of programming. I have a strong interest in creating services, publishing them, and conducting experiments. I particularly enjoy exploring innovative approaches to building and testing various systems.

Apart from programming, I also enjoy spending time with my dog, partner, friends, and family. I have a passion for cooking, particularly Asian and Italian cuisine.
